# guiFLOW
guiFLOW is a matlab potential flow solver. 
This simple program is capable of simulating any of the basic point sources 
(sink, source, vortex, dipole) in superposition. By running the .m file, a 
new figure window will be launched which will allow the user to visually simulate
potential flow in superposition. Information on the simulators use and help can be found by clicking the 
life buoy at the top right of the window. 

This program was developed by Dylan Morano for the University of Rhode Island
